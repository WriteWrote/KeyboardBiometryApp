# KeyboardBiometryApp
Subject: Biometrical Methods of Identification of Personality (BMIL)
Lab-project for the semester.

The app allows to create a user with some credentials to enter the main app window (login and password). At the starting page user can choose login and log in with the password.

After that the window opens where user can type some phrases (one is constant, one is secret and need to be set up by the user), and after that user should tap the button 'Submit'. This will add the statistics to the files in personal catalog of user.

#todo: make a proper DB.

The user should type test phrases around 3-5 times, so the program can analyse his keyboard biometry and make a prediction, is the person typing is actually a user. This prediction comes after tapping the button 'Test'.

Also user can look at the statistics (mean and dispersion).

Also there is an oprion to change password and secret phrase, and program rates chosen password by it's strength. Also user can generate password with different types of strengths.
